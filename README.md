# Heliograph

> The MCP server that gives AI coding agents senior-engineer-level knowledge of your codebase.

Works with **any OpenAI-compatible LLM API** — OpenAI, Mistral, vLLM, Ollama, LiteLLM, Azure OpenAI, or any provider that exposes `/v1/chat/completions`.


Uses **ChromaDB** for vector storage with optional cross-encoder reranking.

## Why Heliograph?

Large codebases (100k–10M LOC) contain knowledge distributed across **five layers**:


Layer | Description | What Agents See | What Heliograph Exposes |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
**Text** | Raw source code files | ✅ All layers | ❌ |
**Structure** | Module hierarchy, imports, inheritance | ❌ | ✅ Tools & call graphs |
**Semantics** | Meaning, intent, relationships | ❌ | ✅ RAG-powered Q&A |
**Conventions** | Team patterns, idioms, best practices | ❌ | ✅ Pattern discovery |
**History** | Evolution, rationale, architectural decisions | ❌ | ✅ Changelog & ADRs |


Most AI coding agents only see layer 1. They struggle with:
- Understanding architecture and design decisions
- Finding cross-cutting concerns and dependencies
- Discovering team conventions and patterns
- Explaining "why" something was implemented a certain way
- Providing accurate answers about large, unfamiliar codebases

Heliograph exposes layers 2–5 as structured MCP tools that AI coding agents can query.

---

## What is Heliograph?

Heliograph is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that transforms your codebase into a knowledge graph your AI coding agents can understand and query. It provides senior-engineer-level context through:


- **29+ MCP tools** across 8 categories for code intelligence, analysis, and discovery
- **Hybrid search pipeline** combining vector search, AST analysis, and GraphRAG (Phase 2)
- **Auto-generated documentation pyramid** (L0→L3) with architecture overviews, intermediate layers, and file-level docs
- **Web interface** for debugging, source citation inspection, and admin tools
- **Change intelligence** with semantic changelog and time-travel capabilities

---

## Strategy

> **Heliograph makes AI-written code trustworthy enough to ship, at the pace AI writes it.**

Everything follows from that sentence.

### The Four Trust Pillars

| # | Pillar | What it delivers | Phase |
|---|--------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Grounding** | Every statement anchored in source. No hallucinated class names or invented methods. | 1 |
| 2 | **Citations** | Every MCP tool response includes verifiable source ranges for external re-checking. | 4 |
| 3 | **Verification** | Proposed changes checked against formal policies (security, invariants, rules) using an SMT solver. | 6 |
| 4 | **Simulation** | Proposed changes traced through call graph + production telemetry to predict impact and regression risk. | 6 + 7 |

Pillars 1 and 2 are the entry fee. Pillars 3 and 4 are what make Heliograph **world-changing** rather than merely useful.

---

## Business Goals

| Horizon | Milestone | Target | Definition of Done |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **H1 2026** | v1.0 (Phases 0–5) | 50 self-hosted pilot installations | Hallucination rate < 2% across all MCP tool responses |
| **H2 2026** | v2.0 (Phase 6) | 5 regulated-industry deployments with formal verification | ≥ 10 project-specific invariants enforced; zero false-positive merges over 30 days |
| **H1 2027** | v3.0 (Phase 7) | 2 deployments with world-model regression prediction | Regression prediction AUC > 0.8 on historical incident data |

## Architecture Overview

Heliograph uses a **hybrid search pipeline** combining multiple techniques:

```
Codebase (workspace/)
    ↓
Codex Agent (/scan) → L3 Documentation (codex_*.md)
    ↓
Synthesize (L3→L2→L1→L0) → ChromaDB Index (.vectordb/)
    ↓
MCP Tools (expert_ask, search_rag, call_graph, etc.)
    ↓
AI Coding Agents (Roo Code, Continue.dev, Cursor, etc.)
```

### Documentation Pyramid

Heliograph builds a dynamic documentation hierarchy:

- **L0** – `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` (the big picture)
- **L1/L2** – Intermediate layers (depth varies by codebase)
- **L3** – `codex_*.md` (one per source file, raw code + generated docs)

Generated documentation is indexed in ChromaDB for fast, accurate search.

## Scaling & Operations

### Horizontal Scaling

Heliograph supports horizontal scaling with shared volumes:

```yaml
services:
  heliograph-1:
    image: heliograph:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./workspace:/app/workspace:ro
      - ./.vectordb:/app/.vectordb
      - ./.graphdb:/app/.graphdb
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
```

**Note:** ChromaDB supports concurrent readers but requires a single writer.

### Health Checks

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz

# Expected: "OK" with 200 status

# Check services
./scripts/deploy.sh status

# View logs
docker compose logs -f web
```

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Backup all persistent volumes
tar -czf heliograph-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz .vectordb/ .graphdb/ context/ projects/
```

---

## Quality & Reliability

### Grounding Contract

Every tool that returns code-related information **MUST** include a `sources` field:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "path": "src/services/user_service.py",
      "line_start": 42,
      "line_end": 67,
      "score": 0.95,
      "text": "...snippet..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Handling

All tools return structured errors:
- `invalid_input` – Input validation failed
- `not_found` – Resource doesn't exist
- `insufficient_evidence` – Cannot ground answer in source
- `tool_error` – Tool-specific failure

### Performance Characteristics

Tool | Typical Latency | Memory Usage | Use Case |
|------|----------------|--------------|----------|
`expert_ask` | 1–3s | 50–200MB | Code Q&A |
`search_rag` | 200–500ms | 10–50MB | Direct search |
`search_graph` | 300–800ms | 20–100MB | Dependency queries |
`read_file` | 10–50ms | 1–10MB | File access |
`call_graph` | 500ms–2s | 50–300MB | Architecture analysis |

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Tools not available"**
- Verify MCP endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse`
- Check client configuration matches Heliograph URL
- Restart both client and Heliograph

**High latency**
- First query after startup takes longer (index loading)
- Check index status: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/stats`
- For large codebases, allow extra time for initial indexing

**"Insufficient evidence"**
- Your query may be too specific for the index
- Try rephrasing or breaking into smaller questions
- Check if relevant files are in your workspace
