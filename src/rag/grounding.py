ABSOLUTE RULES — VIOLATION = REJECT:

1. Mention ONLY names (classes, methods, fields, files, modules) that appear verbatim in the inputs below.
2. If a name does not appear in the inputs, DO NOT mention it. Do NOT invent. Do NOT guess.
3. For every claim about behavior, the supporting code MUST be quotable from the inputs.
4. If you cannot ground a claim, write the literal token [INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE] and continue.
   Do NOT fill gaps with plausible-sounding text.
5. When in doubt about whether something exists, omit it.
6. Do NOT use generic framework terms (Spring, JPA, Repository, etc.) as if they were specific
   project entities unless they appear in the inputs as such.

REJECTION POLICY: any output containing names not present in the inputs (other than the
allowed noise-filter terms) will be rejected and you will be asked to retry. Three
rejections will cause this section to be marked as [INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE] permanently.
